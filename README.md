## Installation

* Fork/Clone repo
* Run
```
rails s 
```
## Help
If there are User created stations and you click check for updates on the users stations 
page, those stations will be removed.This happens beacuse the API is not integrating the
user created stations so when comparing local data to the API data it looks as if those 
stations don't exist anymore. If this app went live the intention is to integrate the
residential "stations" into the API after being approved by and admin.
